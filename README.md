# DogCraft

This is proof of concept project making a bridge between DataDog metrics and Minecraft.
It allows you to view some custom DataDog dashboards within Minecraft. They show the real stuff.

Current features:

- display any metric, as long as you can formulate what you want as a query that returns a row of data
- skin them the way you want, change color, size, position
- customizable through YAML files, describe your Dashboard in a file, feed the program with it and voilÃ , you have a new dashboards
- support multiple dashboards, each dashboard can obviously show several graphs
- support alert buttons (they turn red when everything is on fire !)
- primitive labeling of graphs, the top corner can show a few cubic letters to remind you what this item is
- no dirty artefacts left after you're done with it, programs cleans up all the blocks it did put in the first place
- you can freely move around and play minecraft as you wish, only there are a few blocks dedicated to you total awareness of what's going on in your systems
- graphs are updated on-the-fly, continuously, several times per minute
- ...

Caveats:

- requires a dedicated Minecraft server, one hosted by you, and patched. This should not be a show stopper, but setting this up can be tricky
- yes, the genuine DataDog web UI is faster than this hack
- not production ready, no packaging, and lacks heavy testing

# Getting started

## Dependencies

### Minecraft

#### Install Python requirements

As root:

```
apt-get install python3 idle3 python3-pip # yes, Python 3, version 2.7 won't work
apt-get install openjdk-8-jre             # JDK >= 7
apt-get install git wget
```

#### Get and build Spigot

```
export PYMINECRAFT=$HOME/.pyminecraft     # choose a user-writable folder
install -d $PYMINECRAFT/build             # create the folder
cd $PYMINECRAFT/build                     # go to the right place
git config --global --unset core.autocrlf # need this! you can switch it off after
# now get the latest BuildTools.jar, think of this as a Makefile on steroids
wget https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar
java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.10.2     # replace 1.10.2 by *YOUR* Minecraft version
cp craftbukkit*jar $PYMINECRAFT/
cp spigot*jar $PYMINECRAFT/
```

#### First start

```
cat <<EOF > $PYMINECRAFT/start.sh
#!/bin/sh

java -Xms512M -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M -jar ./spigot-1.10.2.jar
EOF
chmod a+x $PYMINECRAFT/start.sh
cd $PYMINECRAFT
./start.sh
```

At this stage, server should start and ask for EULA agreement.
Edit the file `eula.txt` (has been created in your directory) and replace
`eula=false` by `eula=true`

Re-run it, now you should be able to connect on it with a standard Minecraft client,
using `localhost` as an address. Tip: to change the Minecraft version you're playing with,
change it in your profile (the first Minecraft screen, before you start the game) there's
a dropdown where you can decide to stick to a given version.

Stop the game, either `stop` on the prompt or `CTRL-C`.

#### Installing Raspberry Juice

This is a plugin that is *REQUIRED* for the Python API to work. It should be installed
in the `plugins` directory (typically `/home/<user>/.pyminecraft/plugins`.

https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice

```
cd $PYMINECRAFT/build
wget https://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/917/56/raspberryjuice-1.8.jar
cp raspberryjuice*jar $PYMINECRAFT/plugins/
```

Also switch to creative mode:

```
sed -i "s/gamemode.*/gamemode=1/g" $PYMINECRAFT/server.properties                # creative mode by default
sed -i "s/force-gamemode.*/force-gamemode=true/g" $PYMINECRAFT/server.properties # force creative mode
```

#### Install MCPI

```
cd $PYMINECRAFT/build
git clone https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi
```

Now, as root:

```
pip3 install ./py3minepi
```

Note: an old version, probably Python 2 compatible is available at: https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi

#### Final run

- start your server
- start a client, connect to localhost

From a Python (3!) prompt:

```
import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
s=minecraft.Minecraft.create()
s.postToChat("hello world")
```

is about how to learn programming with Python and Minecraft.

### Freetype

* Additionnally, this program uses `freetype-py` https://github.com/rougier/freetype-py which you can simply install by `pip install freetype-py`.

### DataDog

* Install the datadog python library https://github.com/DataDog/datadogpy
* You also need a DataDog account, along with an `APP_KEY` and an `API_KEY`. Refer to http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/ for details

## Run the program

Once you are ready, the `./demo.sh` shows an example of a possible launcher.

Basically:

```
python3 main.py <mydashboard.yml>
```

The program will expect elements such as the font to be in some precise path, so don't try to launch it from anywhere. For now.

## Tuning

Most of the configuration options are available in the YAML file.

Some environnment vars matter:

- `DATADOG_API_KEY`: the API key
- `DATADOG_APP_KEY`: the APP key
- `DATADOG_API_HOST`: the API host (eg: https://app.datadoghq.com/ )
- `DATADOG_DEMO_DATA`: if set to `True`, the program won't query DataDog API and display random demo data instead instead of read-world data

## Enjoy

# TODO

- make it more interactive, so that the "player" can act on the graph, acknowledge alerts...
- implement a cute white and purple Puppy that shows up with a dashboard hanging on his neck (killer feature!)
- ...
